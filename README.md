# prime-number-finder-kata
This is the final version of the project.
This is a TDD-based approach to finding a prime number input by a user using RSpec and Ruby.

A user can input a range of integers in either direction (ex. from 0-100 or 100-0, negative ranges, negative to positive ranges) and have the program output which of those numbers are prime numbers.
